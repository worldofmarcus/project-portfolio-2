## Wireframes
The wireframes for the game 'Memory of Queen Oblivion' were created in the software [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com). The wireframes have been created for desktop, tablet and mobile devices. The text content wasn't finalized during the wireframe process. There are some visual visual differences compared to the wireframes, the reason being design choices that I made during the creation process.

# Design Choices

* ### Color Scheme
  The color scheme chosen for 'Memory of Queen Oblivion' was extracted from the background image for the game with the online service[Coolors](https://coolors.co/image-picker). The coolors are a mix of different shades of gray, Smoky black and a more red tone called Rosewood. Quite straight forward colors that all are in the darker spectrum of colors. Th reason why I chose a darker tone was because of the game story and game type. I wanted the feeling to be a little bit mysterious. Though the colors are quite dark there is still good readability and contrast. Kommentar: Lägg ev. in var färgerna använts.

* ### Typography
  The fonts used for the game are 'Kaushan Script' and 'Roboto'. Fallback font for both of them is sans-serif. T

  * 'Kaushan Script' is a little bit harder to read than a regular font like Roboto but I wanted to use it because it fits the mysterious context better.

  * 'Roboto' was chosen for the score board to be easy to read with good contrast.
